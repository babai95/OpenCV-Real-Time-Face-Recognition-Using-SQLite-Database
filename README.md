# OpenCV-Real-Time-Face-Recognition-Using-SQLite-Database
In this project, using Open CV modules and classes, a real time face detection and recognition application is made which takes a face as input, trains it using HaarCascade Frontal_face_default Classifier and then recognises it correctly if  multiple random faces are given as input. The images are stored to and retrieved from SQLite Database created in SQLite Studio
